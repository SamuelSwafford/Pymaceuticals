# Analysis of Pharmaceutical Data Using Pandas and Matplotlib

## Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed analysis of pharmaceutical data, focusing on the effects of different drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. The analysis includes data preparation, statistical summaries, visualizations, and regression models.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on two key datasets:
- `Mouse_metadata.csv`: Contains mouse information, including ID, sex, age, and weight.
- `Study_results.csv`: Includes the results of the study, such as tumor volume measurements at different timepoints.

## Objectives
- Merge and clean datasets to prepare for analysis.
- Generate summary statistics for tumor volume across different drug regimens.
- Create bar and pie charts to visualize the data.
- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create box plots for tumor volume data.
- Analyze the effect of the Capomulin treatment through line and scatter plots.
- Determine the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen.

## Analysis Summary
The analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of various drug regimens, with a specific focus on Capomulin. Key findings include:
- Identification of potential outliers in tumor volume data.
- Statistical analysis of tumor volume across different drug regimens.
- Visualization of the distribution of data points using bar charts and pie charts.
- Correlation and regression analysis to understand the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and exploratory visualizations.
- SciPy: For scientific and technical computing.
